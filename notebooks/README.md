# Notebooks: Exploratory Analysis & Machine Learning

## Purpose
This folder contains Jupyter notebooks used for:
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the HMP2 MomSPI dataset.
- Testing preprocessing pipelines for microbiome data.
- Implementing machine learning models (e.g., clustering, PCA, classification) to investigate microbial patterns in pregnancy.

## Usage
- Open notebooks in a JupyterLab or Codespaces environment.
- Each notebook demonstrates a self-contained analysis workflow, from data loading to visualization.
- Dependencies are managed in `requirements.txt`.

## Future Work
- Add notebooks demonstrating model comparison (logistic regression, random forests, etc.).
- Include interactive plots (e.g., Plotly, Altair).
- Publish key notebooks as static HTML for easier viewing on GitHub Pages.
