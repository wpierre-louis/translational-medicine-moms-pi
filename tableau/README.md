# Tableau Workbooks & Extracts

## Purpose
This folder contains Tableau outputs that build on the processed vaginal subset of the HMP2 MomSPI dataset. It includes:
- Tableau packaged workbooks (`.twbx`) for dashboards.
- CSV extracts or hyper extracts used for Tableau visualizations.

## Usage
- Open `.twbx` files directly in Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public.
- Processed data sources are located in `data/processed/` and linked here for reproducibility.

## Future Work
- Add interactive dashboards showing microbial composition over gestational time.
- Include comparative dashboards for different body sites once integrated.
- Provide a published Tableau Public link for recruiters and collaborators.
